Nice to meet you, Alina. To my surprise, you came here.
I am confident that I will get the mysterious treasure.
I hope so. But you have to be careful, you are now in the dark forest, which is the closest place to the Endless Corridor.
Is there anything different here?
The monsters inside will be hundreds of times stronger than those you encountered before.
Be brave and pursue the treasure!
