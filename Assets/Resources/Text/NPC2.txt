Glad you passed the first level.
Am I strong enough?
Far from enough. As you can see, you are now in a deserted desert. Here you have no one to turn to for help but yourself.
Will this be harder than before?
Certainly! Monsters will become stronger. The portal is in the north, you'd better get stronger before going there. There is a very terrible one there.
I think I can overcome it.
Go forward!
